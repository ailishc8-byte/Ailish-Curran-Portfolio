        <div class = "about">
            <p>I was born and raised in Vernon, BC. I attended Okanagan Landing Elementary School
                and Fulton Secondary High School. Growing up, I played a numerous amount of sports. 
                including hockey, soccer, basketball, volleyball, skiing, and dance. Our soccer team 
                won the provincial championship in .... 
                Playing several team sports taught me to work with others and developed my 
                communication skills. I will never forget the fun I had during these sports.

            <p>Growing up I was always a high achiever. Throughout elementary 
                it was a goal of mine to get straight A's. Math always came easy to me.
                My parents noticed my math skills at a young age contrary to my writing. 
                In grade 12 there was a calculus course offered and it was this class that 
                pursued me to major in math in University. For first year sciences I went
                to Okanagan College in Vernon and transfered to the University of British
                Columbia for my second and following years.

            After completing a Math degree my goal was to become a Chartered Professional 
            Accountant. I spent 6 months at BDO. Most of this was preparing tax returns. 
            Although becoming an accountant would have been a solid decision, there 
            was something about it that didn't fuel my passion. Following this, I worked
            at Nadine's Fine Art and Frames for several months and after moved to Salmon 
            Arm to work as a bookkeeper. I worked at Salmon Arm Bookkeeping and Business 
            Services for two years.
