# Ailish-Curran-Portfolio
A portfolio all about myself. Includes projects, hobbies, games, contact information and more. 

February 28, 2026: 
I started to code the homepage of my portfolio. I used colorhunt as inspiration for the color scheme. Currently, I have not added in 
writing, this is something I will do at the end. I have one image added therefore the next steps will be to add the appropriate images for each section. 
I included a small animation allowing the content on the page to fade in. 

Action Items:
1. Finish the homepage
2. Start building a game to showcase my knowledge of javascrip and components.
